        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        
        <p class="bubble">Situated on the coast of England, Liverpool has been traditionally known as a working class city.
        The Port of Liverpool has been historically a massive center for commerce for the island, and a huge opportunity for
        the citizens of the city to provide for their families. Along with the gruff working class, the citizens have an undying
        alliegence to whichever side of town theyre from. Originally the blues of Everton played at Anfield park, but in 1891 they
        moved across the park (quite literally) and Liverpool F.C was formed and took the vacant property at Anfield Road. 
        Liverpool F.C have played in this location eversince, and this close proximity and undying local alliegence to either 
        the Red or Blue has created one of the fiercest English football derby's. Over the years many other rivalries have developed
        as the love English fans have for their teams is immense. Further in the website we will examine some more rivalries as 
        well as take a look at the trophy collection Liverpool F.C have collected. The impact Liverpool F.C have had on the Merseyside
        community over the last 100+ years has been huge. From community events to uniting the town on game nights, there's an
        atmosphere not only at Anfield but through the entire town that cannot be truly described with words.</p>
